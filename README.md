# FizzBuzz
Had a talk with a very fascinating person and it got me inspired to do this fizzbuzz project Tom Scott talked about in a 100 year old language

adjust the TIMES TO SIMULATE to change how many iterations to run through.

TODO: make a random number generator based on the fizzbuzz data and use that to calculate a yes or no decision
